## PH4390
### Computational Methods in Physics

#### Overview
I have had the opportunity to develop and instruct the PH4390 class at Michigan Tech. now for two semesters.
The course is designed to give senior level undergraduate students and new graduate students an introduction to the unix/linux environment, basic coding practices and the skills necessary to solve problems using numerical techniques.
My personal goal of the course was the give the students the basic understanding of modeling and provide the with a basic toolkit to get some started on any problem.

I was assigned the class as a fourth year graduate student and given the task to develop the course from the ground up.
Having some prior experience with taking the class and being a teaching assistant I put together the following framework to the best of abilities and each student was able to acquire new skills from the course.
This course provides unique challenges with the varying levels of students that take this class.
I had a wide range of students, many have never compiled a program before, while others were writing multithreaded programs in C in the first few weeks of the course.
