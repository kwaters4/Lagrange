### Kevin Waters
### PhD. Candidate at Michigan Tech.

I am a graduate student in the [Department of Physics at Michigan Technological University](http://www.mtu.edu/physics/)
where I am currently working with my advisor [Dr. Pandey](http://www.mtu.edu/physics/department/faculty/pandey/) on electronic structure theory.

The site is under construction, but feel free to browse around where there are completed and semi-completed elements.
